BRIDGE FOUNDRY, INC.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MEETING MINUTES

November 19th, 2025

Board Members Present: Melissa Xie, Sarah Allen, Margaret Parsa
	
This meeting of the Bridge Foundry Board of Directors was held on Wednesday, November 19, 05:30 p.m. PT, having a quorum with everyone participating through an online video conference with live audio and screen-sharing.

Sarah Allen motioned to update the Bridge Foundry Background Check Policy. We have changed vendors and in doing so would like to generalize the policy to remove specific mention of a prior vendor and its information sources.  The revised policy is attached here as an addendum.

This motion was duly seconded by Melissa Xie and passed unanimously by the board.

The board reviewed and unanimously accepted the November 19th, 2025 minutes.

Respectfully submitted,


Margaret Parsa
