**Background Check Policy**
**November 19, 2025**

Bridge Foundry runs a criminal background check for all employees, contractors, and volunteers who will be making payments out of Bridge Foundry accounts. Before a background check is conducted, the individual must sign a release form that complies with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

Candidates for these roles may be disqualified on the basis of any criminal history related to fraud or financial misconduct. Other types of criminal history may also be a basis for disqualification if they relate to the candidate’s ability to perform their role appropriately. Candidates should not be disqualified for unrelated history.
